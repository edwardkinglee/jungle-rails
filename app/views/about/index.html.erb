   <h3>Welcome to the Jungle Shop!</h3>
   
     <p>Our founders started out as a group of childhood friends that all had a passion for nature and the outdoors. Post college, they ended up becoming roommates. Turns out, having a home filled with plants was something they continued to have in common. Unfortunately, they found it difficult to find a place online to purchase houseplants that was easy to navigate and wasnâ€™t just geared to wholesale. So, in 2017, they decided to launch jungle.com to be the ultimate destination for everything houseplants.
     </p>
     <p>Originally working out of the humble house they shared, jungle.com has now grown to occupy a much larger and well equipped greenhouse based in Southern California.
     </p>
     <p>Today, we still treat every order with the same care as we did working out of the small backyard and garage we started in.
     </p>
     <p>From our house to yours.
